–What is object oriented programming?

Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm, or way to structure your code based around the concept of objects and helps to bring the structure of the code closer to how things work in real life. 


–What is a class?

Classes are an encapsulation of real life concepts with common characteristics and are the top level of organization of the OOP and can encapsulate several objects.

–What is an object? 
An object is a data structure that stores different properties of a particular entity.

–what is an instance?

An instance is the part of the code where an object is executed or called upon. 

–what is a property?

A property is a quality an object can have. 

–what is a method?

A method is a function associated with an object. It is a behavior or function proper of the object.

–What is the difference between a method and a function?
Very little. A method is just a function executed in relationship to an object.

–What is a constructor?
A function that executes its code when a new object in a class is declared. 

–What is the difference between a class, object and instance. 

A class sets the properties that different objects have in common, an object is a data structure that stores several properties and can be several inside a class, an instance is when the object is called or executed.

–What do we understand about the concept of encapsulation?
This concept refers to the activity of bundling data and methods to call that data in a single unit like a class.

–What do we understand about the concept of abstraction?

It is the level of detail that you want in order to define what is gonna be your class, object and properties.

–What do we understand about the concept of inheritance?
We understand for inheritance the passing down of properties and methods from a class to a subclass.

–What do we understand about the concept of polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability in programming to have the same interface to perform in several different capacities depending on the situation. 

–What do we understand about the concept of Overload?
Overloading is an specific case of polymorphism where some methods have different implementations depending on the arguments the get passed as parameters. 

–What do we understand about the concept of Override?
Override is when you redefine a pre existing method 

–What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?
These concepts are completely different as the first one allows for the same method to have different capabilities depending on the incoming arguments; the second one just redefines the entire thing so even if the arguments are the same, the actions executed by that method will be completely different. 

–What is a static class?
Static classes are classes that allow you to call the methods of the class outside the instance of the class itself. In a way, a global class. 

–Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms

-A better structure of the code which allows for other programmers to understand it easier and make it more long lasting.

-Better security as some methods can only be acessed inside their scope making them more secure from malicious attacks.
